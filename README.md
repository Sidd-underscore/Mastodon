## About this Repl

> The current configuration for the Repl is *development*. To upgrade to *production*, follow the [instructions](#upgrading-to-production)

This is a Bash repl, which is essentially just a shell where programs can be run. Being a *one-click runable* repl, all you have to do to have your very own Mastodon instance is click the run button. I also reccomend you give this repl an **8x boost** and **enable Always On**. Both of these options are availible through Hacker plans.

### How this Repl Works

All the files you view were generated through cloning the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon) of Mastodon and scripts located in [`start.sh`](/start.sh). Said scripts initiate (in order):

1. **[Redis](https://redis.io/)**, that caches for PostgreSQL.
2. **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)**, the database system
3. **[Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)**, used as a reverse proxy (it "sits in front of web servers and forwards client (e.g. web browser) requests to those web servers" - [Cloudflare, What is a reverse proxy?](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/#:~:text=A%20reverse%20proxy%20is%20a,security%2C%20performance%2C%20and%20reliability.))
4. Mastodon! (using **[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)**)

The Mastodon files in the GitHub repo are located in [`./live`](/live). The rest of the files and folders are explained [here](#folder-file-explanation).

### Tech Stack
- **[Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)** powers the REST API and other web pages
- **[React.js](https://reactjs.org/)** and **[Redux](https://redux.js.org/)** are used for the dynamic parts of the interface
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** powers the streaming API

### Running this Repl locally

Unfortunately, this Repl is designed to run on Replit's machines, and cannot be easily converted to run on a personal computer. However, this isn't necessarily a bad thing, since it literally will only take one click of Replit's "Run" button to have this instace running.

### Customizing this Mastodon instance

To truly have your own verion of Mastodon, it is essential that it works correctly and displays your Mastodon instance's information. To do this:

1. Head to the [`.env.production.sample`](/live/.env.production.sample) in the `live/` folder
2. Enter the correct information
   - Details and instructions are already there!
   - Mailgun is used for the SMPT server, but it can be changed to whatever you like
4. Restart the server!

## Upgrading to Production 

Upgrading is quite simple:

1. Head over to [`start.sh`](/start.sh) and edit **line 24, column 21 through 32** to say `production` instead of `development`
2. Jump to [`.replit`](/.replit) and edit **line 12, column 12 through 23** to say `production` instead of `development`
3. Restart the server!
4. üéÜ
