## About this Repl

> The current configuration for the Repl is *development*. To upgrade to *production*, follow the [instructions](#upgrading-to-production)
> 
This is a Bash repl, which is essentially just a shell where programs can be run. Being a *one-click runable* repl, all you have to do to have your very own Mastodon instance is click the run button. I also reccomend you give this repl an **8x boost** and **enable Always On**. Both of these options are availible through Hacker plans.

### How this Repl Works

All the files you view were generated through cloning the [GitHub Repo](https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon) of Mastodon and scripts located in [`start.sh`](/start.sh). Said scripts initiate (in order):

1. **[Redis](https://redis.io/)**, that caches for PostgreSQL.
2. **[PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/)**, the database system
3. **[Nginx](https://www.nginx.com/)**, used as a reverse proxy (it "sits in front of web servers and forwards client (e.g. web browser) requests to those web servers" - [Cloudflare, What is a reverse proxy?](https://www.cloudflare.com/learning/cdn/glossary/reverse-proxy/#:~:text=A%20reverse%20proxy%20is%20a,security%2C%20performance%2C%20and%20reliability.))
4. Mastodon! (using **[Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/)**)

The Mastodon files in the GitHub repo are located in [`./live`](/live). The rest of the files and folders are explained [here](#folder-file-explanation).

### Tech Stack
- **[Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/)** powers the REST API and other web pages
- **[React.js](https://reactjs.org/)** and **[Redux](https://redux.js.org/)** are used for the dynamic parts of the interface
- **[Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)** powers the streaming API

### Running this Repl locally

1. To run this repl on *your* machine, head over to the [GitHub](https://github.com/Sidd-underscore/Mastodon).
2. Download the code from there (Replit doesn't like downloading big Repls)
3. Extract the zip file and either `cd` into the resulting folder through the terminal or righ-click on the resulting folder and open it with the terminal
4. Run
   ```sh
   sh start.sh
   ```
5. The code should start the Redis server, install everything and open a port.

   ***THIS PROCESS MAY TAKE A WHILE AND IS INCREDIBLY RESOURCE-CONSUMING***

## Upgrading to Production 

Upgrading is quite simple:

1. Head over to [`start.sh`](/start.sh) and edit **line 24, column 21 through 32** to say `production` instead of `development`
2. Jump to [`.replit`](/.replit) and edit **line 12, column 12 through 23** to say `production` instead of `development`
3. Restart the server!
